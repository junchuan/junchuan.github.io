## What is functional? 

A `functional` takes a function and returns an output value. For example, a functional can calculate the length of a curve. The curve path is defined by a function. Another common example in machine learning community is that an Entropy functional will take any probability density function and return a scalar value representing the entropy of `x` under the density.  
Like in conventional calculus, we seek a function `y(x)` that maximizes the value of the functional `F(y)`. For example, the shortest path between two points is a straight line(i.e., the function describing the curve path will be a straight line equation).  

How much would `F(y)` change if we make a small change `(x)` to the function `y(x)`?
