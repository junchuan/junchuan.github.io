[netCDF](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/multidimensional/fundamentals-of-netcdf-data-storage.htm) (network Common Data Form) is a file format for storing multidimensional scientific data (variables) such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and direction (e.g., temperature varying with time in an area ). 

A netCDF file contains *dimensions*, *variables*, and *attributes*. These components are used together to capture the meaning of data and relations among data fields in an array-oriented dataset.The structure of a netCDF file is described using CDL. 

```
netcdf filename {  
dimensions:
	lat = 3 ;
	lon = 3 ;
	time = UNLIMITED ;      
variables:
	float lat(lat) ;
		lat:units = "degrees_north" ;
	float lon(lon) ;
		lon:units = "degrees_east" ;
        double time(time) ;
                time:units = "seconds since 2009-01-01" ;
	float pr(time, lat, lon) ;
                pr:standard_name = "air_pressure_at_sea_level" ;
		pr:units = "hPa" ;
     :title="example CDL";

data:

 lat = 25, 30, 35;
 lon = -125, -110, -95 ;
 time = 7776000, 15552000 ;
 pr =
  900.5, 901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911,
  912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917;
}
```
