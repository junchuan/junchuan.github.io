## Brief Description

In colloboration with [National Advanced Driving Simulation Center](https://www.nads-sc.uiowa.edu/), this research project aims to model naturalistic driving behavior using big GPS trajectory data, partically naturally parking behavior such that unintended acceleration accident during parking can be prevented.
- Design a geospatial semantic model for naturalistic driving behavior
- Develop a spatiotemporal analytical framework to identify and analyze different naturalistic parking behavior from big vehicle GPS trajectory data.
