Author: G. Polya

1. Understanding the problem. What is unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?
2. Devise a plan
	- Have you seen it before?
	- Do you know a related problem?
	- Look at the unknown, and try to think of a familiar problem having the same  or similar unknown
	- Try to solve some related problem if you cannot solve the proposed problem (e.g., more general, more specific, an analogous problem , part of the problem, keep only part of the conditions, Boundary scenario)
3. Carry out the plan
4. Looking back. Check the result, derive the result differently,use the result â€¦
