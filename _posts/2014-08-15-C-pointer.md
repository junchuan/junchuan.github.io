### C Pointer
- Every pointer has an associated type
- Every pointer has a value
- Pointer is created with `&` operator.
- Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value. 
- Pointers can also point to functions. The value of a function pointer is the address of the first instruction in the machine-code representation of the function.
