## Brief Description
Working with University of Iowa Facility Management Office, this project developed a web-based flood risk monitoring system for campus facilities. The system makes spatiotemporal prediction about campus buildings' flood vulnerabilities based on  real-time flood stage information published by [NWS](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Iowa+City&state=IA&site=DVN&textField1=41.6583&textField2=-91.5351&e=0).
