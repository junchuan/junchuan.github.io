## Several principles for good writing:
- Most readers expect the action of a clause to be found in a verb. If you fail to put your intended action in a verb, then the reader has to work to determine where the action is. 
- Put characters in subjects. The character is the actor, the entity performing the action. Readers expect the main character in a clause to be found in the subject. 
- Writing is easier to follow when the string of subjects in a paragraph reflects the topics. Paragraph units are most effective when they either 1) discuss a single topic; 2) discuss a series of related topics that build on one another. 

## Fulfill the readersâ€™ expectation. There are two ways to achieve this: 
- Maintain a common subject throughout a one-topic paragraph;
- Shift the subject appropriately according to the story
- Keep subjects near verbs. Reader are constantly looking for the answers to the following two questions: 
	- 1) who is the sentence about? 
	- 2) What are they doing? 

## Coheresion 
- Put new information last. Most readers will find your writing more clear if you consistently begin sentences with familiar information and conclude sentences with unfamiliar information. 
- Use passive voice judiciously. Use passive voice when it moves the old information to the front and new information to the back. 
- Make sure the first and last sentences of a paragraph match. 
- Readers usually expect thoughts to be expressed in paragraph units. Make sure that each sentence in a paragraph supports the main point of the paragraph.
