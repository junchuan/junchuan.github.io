## Brief Description
 In collaboration with [Maryland Transportation Institute](https://mti.umd.edu/), this research aims to develop an integrated travel behavior and dynamic traffic assignment modeling tool and adapt the tool for real-time and dynamic analysis of active traffic management (ATM) strategies. CGIS team is in charge of developing an analytic module to detect driving behavior change from big GPS trajectory data in response to geospatial events.
