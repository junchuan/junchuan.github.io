Last week, I was collecting COVID-19 case data of Florida state for a pending NSF RAPID proposal. I thought I might as well do this for all 50 states and create a county-level visualization to show the daily development of COVID-19 pandemic in the US. After a couple of days of work, here is the result:

This visualization is created using data sources from [1Point3Acres](https://coronavirus.1point3acres.com/en), which has a comprehensive list of each COVID-19 case in the US since Jan 21st,2020.

The visualization includes three different layers, namely, number of COVID-19 cases for each county, top ten counties that have the largest increase of cases, top ten counties with highest mortality rate due to coronavirus.
