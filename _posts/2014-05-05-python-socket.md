### Python networking module

- Sockets: endpoints of a bidirectional communication channel
	- stream sockets: delivery in a networked environment is guaranteed (use TCP)
	- datagram sockets: delivery in a networked environment is not guaranteed (use UDP)
	- raw sockets: provide user access to the underlying communication protocols	
	- sequenced packet sockets
