### [A New Kind of Science](hhttps://www.wolframscience.com/nks/)  
Author: Stephen Wolfram 

  
> What are the general features capturing human intelligence, independent of details of human?

> Any system that behaves not *obviously simple* has an equivalent computation power as our most sophisticated computer.  

> The whole idea of using mathematical formula to describe behavior only makes sense when behavior are *computationally reducible*. 

> If a system is *computationally irreducible*, there is a tangible separation between the underlying rules of the system and the overall behavior associated with the irreducible amount of computation work needed to go from one to the other. 

> Real unpredictability can arise from *definite underlying rules*. 

> The structure of a theory will consist of a number of formulas that states relationships between *meaningless objects* and a *deductive net* that binds these formulas together in a consistent and homogeneous set.   

> *Computable function* are the mathematical function that can be calculated by a mechanical calculation  device given unlimited storage space and time,i.e., any function that has an algorithm is computable.
