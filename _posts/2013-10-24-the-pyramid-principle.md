### [The Pyramid Principle](https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Principle-Logic-Writing-Thinking/dp/0273710516)  
Author: Barbara Minto  

The logic of writing  
> Only when you express your thoughts - in writing or in speech, you have a firm grasp of your thoughts. (人们只有将自己的思想表达出来--说出来或写下来，才能准确的把握自己的思想.)  

Story telling
> Four steps: situation --》conflict --》 problem --》answer  

The logic of thinking
> Randomly collecting data is not the smart way to do things. You have to force yourself to diagnose the possible cause of a problem, and then use scientific methods:
- hypothesis
- analyze problem structure
- find the causal factors
- collect data to carry out experiment. The key for designing an experiment is to exclude/control all the factors that could weaken your ability to reach a definite conclusion. 
- find solution 

The logic of presentation
> - create image to help understand and memorize
- If ideas are abstract, try to use hierarchical structure to illustrate
