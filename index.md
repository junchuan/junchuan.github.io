## Who am I ?

Hi, I am Junchuan Fan, a GIScience and computational social science researcher interested in human activity and movement, and human place interactions.  
My current research mostly focus on using big spatiotemporal data analytics to **uncover human activity and mobility pattern in space, analyze semantic characteristics of places infused by human activities therein, and model the dynamic interactions between human and places**. 

Check out my [C.V. here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PoyEGga4Y5A0dTorYs8L0Lygnu1tMwT4imiX2k-FUHA/edit?usp=sharing).

## What I do ?

Currently, I am a Research Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
Previously, I was an assistant research professor at the Center for Geospatial Information Science in the University of Maryland, College Park. I taught courses on *GIS programming, advanced spatial analytics, and web mapping*.  

Most of data crunching I do are carried out using python, R and scala. Sometimes, I also work as a volunteer data scientist for [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/).
