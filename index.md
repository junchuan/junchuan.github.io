## Who am I?

Hi, I am Junchuan Fan, a GIScience and computational social science researcher focusing on the study of human activities and mobility in space.  
I am mostly interested in using big geospatial data computing approaches to study *human activity and movement in space*, *characteristics of places infused by human activities therein*, and *the dynamic interactions between place and people*. 

Check out my [C.V. here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PoyEGga4Y5A0dTorYs8L0Lygnu1tMwT4imiX2k-FUHA/edit?usp=sharing).  
Or, you can view [C.V. in space time]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cv/index.html %}).  

## What I do?
Currently, I am working as a postdoc researcher in the University of Maryland. I rely heavily on big data computing tools to analyze massive spatial-temporal-social data (e.g., GPS trajectory, cellphone records, social media data), and extract knowledge that can inform decision-making in transportation planning, driving safety etc. Most of data wrangling are carried out in apache spark and geomesa using python,java or scala.  
Sometimes, I work as a volunteer data scientist for [DataKind](http://www.datakind.org/).
