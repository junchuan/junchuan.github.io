## Who am I?
Hi, I am Junchuan Fan, a GIScience and computational movement science researcher.  I am interested in human activity and movement dynamics, as well as place semantics and interactions between people and place. 

check out my [C.V. in space time]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link cv/index.html %}).  
Or, you can view my regular [C.V. here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PoyEGga4Y5A0dTorYs8L0Lygnu1tMwT4imiX2k-FUHA/edit?usp=sharing).


## What I do?
I study human movement dynamics through **big geosocial data**, including *movement trajectory data* to uncover human mobility pattern. 
Also, I analyze natural language data associated with locations to understand the *semantics of a place* and how they potentially impact human activities.
