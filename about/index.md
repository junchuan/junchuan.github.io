## Who am I?
Hi, I am Junchuan Fan, a GIScience and computational social science researcher.  I am interested in human activity and movement dynamics, place semantics 
and interactions between them. 

## What I do?
I apply big data computing techniques to analyze *human activity data* and *movement trajectories* to uncover human mobility pattern. 
Also, I analyze natural language data associated with locations to understand the *semantics of a place* and how they potentially impact human activities.
